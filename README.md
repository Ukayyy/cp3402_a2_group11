Assignment 2 in CP3402 for HealthPartners

//Group Member: CAI WEI

//Group Project: Health Partners

//Project Struture

//GitHub for Group work:
Health Partners was formed by two long-time health activists who have devoted 10s of thousands of hours to volunteer work. 
They work for human health, the health of the environment and the health of our fellow animals, especially those animals trapped on factory farms. Although we are now also starting to run a business, our activism remains central, and we continue to actively volunteer.
